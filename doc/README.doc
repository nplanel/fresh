/*! \mainpage Fresh - A Qt extension library

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/pasnox/fresh/home/">Fresh</a> is a <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a> extension library.

As an extension library it add usefull \ref FreshCore and \ref FreshGui classes to extend the possibilities offered by the excellent Qt.
It runs on any operating system supported by Qt (eg. Windows, UNIX/Linux, MacOS/X).

This documentation describes Fresh for Qt 4.

Fresh also includes language bindings for <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. 
These require that <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/">PyQt</a> v4 is also installed.

This version of Fresh is based on Qt v4.7.x.

<h2>Licensing</h2>

Fresh is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License v3</a>.
And allow both closed and open source applications to use it.

See the file "LICENSE" to see what license this copy of Fresh is released under.

<h2>Installation</h2>

As supplied Fresh will be built as a static library and installed in the Qt installation folder.

To build Fresh, run:

<pre>
    qmake fresh.pro
    make
    sudo make install
</pre>

If you have both Qt v3 and v4 installed then make sure you use the correct version of <tt>qmake</tt>.

Depending on the compiler you are using you may need to run <tt>nmake</tt> rather than <tt>make</tt>.

Once installed, use it that way in your project:

<pre>
    CONFIG *= fresh_static
</pre>

You can replace fresh_static by fresh_shared if you built Fresh in shared mode.

<h2>Example Application</h2>

The example application provided demonstrate nearly all available classes in Fresh.

To build the example, run:

<pre>
    qmake subdirs.pro
    make
</pre>

On Windows (and depending on the compiler you are using) you may need to run <tt>nmake</tt> rather than <tt>make</tt>.

<h2>Qt Designer Plugin (not yet available)</h2>

Fresh includes an optional plugin for Qt Designer that allows Fresh widgets to be included in GUI designs just like any other Qt widget.

To build the plugin on all platforms, make sure Fresh is installed and then run (as root or administrator):

<pre>
    qmake designer.pro
    make
    make install
</pre>

On Windows (and depending on the compiler you are using) you may need to run <tt>nmake</tt> rather than <tt>make</tt>.
