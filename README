Fresh is a library extending the Qt library by adding new classes/widgets.
It's developped by Filipe AZEVEDO (Nox P@sNox, pasnox@gmail.com)
The library had python bindings created by Andrei KOPATS (hlamer, hlamer@tut.by), see python-bindings branch.
The python bindings are discontinued it's why they have been moved to the python-bindings branch, feel free to take over.
